# Website-Design - FBLA
We've used HTML and CSS to create a website for the locally owned business, Shanghai Gardens.

How to run the Website:

Open the GitHub repository, and click on the green button that says "Code". 
From there download the zip file. 
Open downloads folder. 
Extract files from the previously mentioned zip file.
Open the extracted file, then open the "home" file with a browser.
